## Enhancement 1 - Software Design and Engineering

This artifact is a full stack application utilizing the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) development stack that was created over the course of 8 weeks in CS-465, a full stack development class. This web application provides users with information on different travel packages by connecting a front-end webpage to a back-end server. The application also supports an administrative webpage that facilitates changes to data without requiring manual access to the database itself.


This artifact exemplifies all facets of software development - from the basics of coding and engineering all the way to user interface/experience designing. As a large-scale project, this application offered many opportunities for improvement. Search times for digging through documents in the database, client-side and administrative-side webpage appearance and designs, and the methods and techniques used to connect the various data structures across different platforms are all areas that highlight my skills and abilities. In this particular enhancement, a registration page was implemented so that administrators could create profiles without needing to access the database directly. This involved generating a new service component that handles new user information along with creating an intuitive webpage which allows administrators to put in their data.


This enhancement covers a broader range of concepts and skillsets and so meets all 5 Course Outcomes. Thorough commenting was included in all enhanced files, the user interface for the administrative webpage was improved, a new functionality was implemented, techniques to share data across the system were used, and thorough error handling and credential management were employed for this enhancement.


Enhancing and modifying the artifact was more challenging than I assumed due to the nature of full stack applications. Many files are intertwined with one another and work in unison to create a full-fledged system that stores and displays different kinds of information. Seemingly simple tasks such as creating a form submission page become tedious when the data it holds needs to be shared across all other parts of the system. At the same time, I can see the efficiency and utility full-stack frameworks are capable of providing once one is well-versed in understanding their techniques and recognizing their data flow.
